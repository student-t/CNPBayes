  Abstract                 = {Copy number variation (CNV) is pervasive
                  in the human genome and can play a causal role in
                  genetic diseases. The functional impact of CNV
                  cannot be fully captured through linkage
                  disequilibrium with SNPs. These observations
                  motivate the development of statistical methods for
                  performing direct CNV association studies. We show
                  through simulation that current tests for CNV
                  association are prone to false-positive associations
                  in the presence of differential errors between cases
                  and controls, especially if quantitative CNV
                  measurements are noisy. We present a statistical
                  framework for performing case-control CNV
                  association studies that applies likelihood ratio
                  testing of quantitative CNV measurements in cases
                  and controls. We show that our methods are robust to
                  differential errors and noisy data and can achieve
                  maximal theoretical power. We illustrate the power
                  of these methods for testing for association with
                  binary and quantitative traits, and have made this
                  software available as the R package CNVtools.},
